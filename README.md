## About the System 

* Researchers in the fields of plant physiology, biotechnology, and eco-physiology are studying blind features of primary and secondary macronutrients for their potential impact on plant life.

* Macronutrients play crucial roles in various metabolic processes throughout the life of a plant.

* pH measurement is conducted using the 1:2.5 H2O method, organic carbon is measured using the Walkley-Black method, and electrical conductivity is measured in Deci Siemens per meter (dS/m).

* Macronutrients (N, P, K, S) are quantified in kilograms per hectare (Kg/Ha), while micronutrients (Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, B) are quantified in parts per million (ppm).

* Measuring macronutrient levels in soil is essential for maintaining and enhancing productivity, preventing soil degradation, improving fertilizers, and addressing environmental issues.

* Effective nutrient management is crucial, involving proper soil analysis and fertilizer application.

* Soil parameters like fertility indices for macronutrients, soil pH, soil type, and preferred crops are relevant for determining fertilizer recommendations.

* This system is proposed to classify the fertility levels of primary macronutrients (Nitrogen, Potassium, Phosphorus) based on soil test report values.

* This classification helps recommend appropriate fertilizer amounts, saving time and expenses associated with detailed chemical analysis by specialized technicians.
